#How do I approach designing software?
  When designing software I will usually determine the specifics of the problem(s) being solved, the most direct route to solving the problem(s), and then followed the simplest implementation of the     
  solution(s)
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  This project provided for oppurunities to apply graph based arithmetic to determine the points that supply the backbone of various 3D shapes 
What design process did you follow for your project work?
  The design process for constructing this 3D scene starts with understanding the coordinates that will be used as backbones for all the 3D shapes within this scene, followed by understanding how   
  connecting these point can generate 2D triangles may will be able to act as a proper skin covering the entire surface of each 3D object, then I followed steps to appropriately texture the objects and 
  step lighting behaviors.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  In future works I will likely rely heavily upon coding fundamentals and mathematics to reach project goals, especially when utilizing complex software packages such as the OpenGL framework.

#How do I approach developing programs?
  When developing software I will often comment out existing code that I plan to edit or replace entirely so I may check back on old functiopnality during the updating process, I will also code one 
  section or branch at a time since losing focus during implementation can cost more time than implementing individual branches does.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  Due to interdependency issues within the OpenGL framework, I often myself coding all functions, calls and alterating to meshes before moving onto coding all functions, calls and alterating relating to 
  textures and the same with lighting, etc.
How did iteration factor into your development?
  I considered each object an iteration, inwhich I coded for the object's component meshes and textures before moving onto the next object.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  Through this project I have learned much about the OpenGL framework and it's operation and began coding individual modules for each mesh generation since these operations can become long-winded and 
  require thorough commenting.

#How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  Beyond a simple curiousity about software, learning about computer science will help me understand the impact that sciences are having on the modern world and what may be the state of the world in   
  years to come.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  Although I do not have much interest in graphic design or the gaming industries, it is paramount to understand how code is utilized to describe a 3D envirnoment to a GPU for rendering and how powerful    these tools are for bringing imagination to life. The skills I can taking away from this project may only apply to giving style to system menus but these graphical abilities will allow me to create     
  unique visual environments.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  As previously meantioned I do not have strong interest in graphical design but the skills I gained during this project will certainly give a strong base to work off of should I find myself in the position to implement another 3D/2D scene in the future.
